Tool for Playing around Internet Protocols.

you need to insert a "https" link or an IP for example "35.196.132.85"

once you have enterd one of them you have to select how many threads it sends to the IP or Website

when you run it, it should look like this (i used an school website as example)

<img width="1107" height="579" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6b01a00-c481-4b1b-a893-5f8ed2322a10" />


After that the website should have gotten attacked and will crash

if you want the ddos attack to last longer u can make it do so by selecting more threads like 10000

if you did it with an IP the wifi router shouldnt be working or be very laggy for some time eventually it might crash cuz of too many threads

Friendly reminder to NOT forget VPN as its important so nothing happens to you                     

If you need help to run it dm me on discord
